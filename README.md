Adoption Shop was my front-end capstone at Nashville Software School.

It allows users to search for dogs available for adoption based off of breed and zip code. Users can also search for shelters based off of zip code. Users can then "favorite" dogs and shelters and save them to a "favorites" list.

For this app, I used AngularJS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, CSS, and the PetFinder API.


Instructions for install:

cd into lib
run npm install
run bower install
run gulp
